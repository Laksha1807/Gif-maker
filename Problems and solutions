üêû Troubleshooting Steps
While developing this tool, I encountered and solved the following issues:

1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imageio'
‚úÖ Solution: Installed the module via pip:
pip install imageio
2. FileNotFoundError: The directory does not exist
‚ùå Input: "C:\Users\KIIT\code\projects C:\Users\KIIT\code\team-pic2.png"

‚úÖ Solution: Removed accidental spaces in the input path.

3. FileNotFoundError: No such file: 'C:\Users\KIIT\code\projects\team-pic1.png'
‚ùå Input: Only the filename without path when the script wasn't in the same directory.

‚úÖ Solution: Either run the script in the same folder as the images or give the full path to each image.
